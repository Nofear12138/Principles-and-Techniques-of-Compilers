# Principles-and-Techniques-of-Compilers
Principles and Techniques of Compilers in BNU 2022 Autumn

## Course information

Teacher：Hua Luan

Teaching Assistant：Hang Zhao

The labs come from the [Principles and Techniques of Compilers](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/changxu/2_compiler/index.html) in NJU.

Overall framework of this code is referred to [Tyler-ytr/Compiler: NJU 2020 编译原理实验 (github.com)](https://github.com/Tyler-ytr/Compiler).Based on it, we beautified the code style and optimized some labs.

**In case of infringement, please contact me.**

My course grades are 95 and 91, the weighed grade is 93. The final exam requires good preparation.

## Some considerations

* The code is just for reference, there must be some problems because when we done the lab3 or lab4, we known that there were a lot of examples to check the code. So I can only guarantee that it will work for most of the examples.

  For example, there were some omissions in lab1 when it was checked by the TA. If you want to get higher grade, remember to construct or try more examples.

* If you want to get more related labs, you can search the course keyword in github, you can add 'NJU' or '南京大学' to search.

* In lab5, due to the limited capacity of our group, no modification was made compared with Tyler-ytr.

* Only my personal experiment report is included, and the rest of the group's division of labor is not provided for now.

## About Homework

If the assignment is unchanged, I have a version of the answer here, you can contact me to get it. But it is just for reference only.
